🚀 Database Developer | Data Enthusiast | Problem Solver 🚀 <br />
I’m a passionate Database Developer with a strong mathematical and analytical background, driven by a love for solving complex problems and creating data-driven solutions that propel organizations forward. My journey in data and technology has been fueled by a deep curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. <br />
💼 Current Role: Database Developer at Hellenic National Defence General Staff's Ground Satellite Station
At the heart of Greece’s defense infrastructure, I design and maintain databases that are critical to the station's operations. From creating personnel databases in Access to managing satellite image data with Python and automating daily routines using ArcGIS scripting, my role is all about optimizing processes, ensuring data integrity, and driving efficiency.  <br />
🎓 Educational Background: Master’s in Computational and Statistical Data Analytics (MCDA) 
My academic journey at the University of Patras equipped me with cutting-edge skills in machine learning, database management, and statistical analysis. I dove deep into the world of algorithms, neural networks, and data visualization, culminating in a thesis on applying Item Response Theory (IRT) in machine learning—merging statistical theory with practical AI applications. <br />
🔍 What I Bring to the Table:
Database Mastery: Proficient in SQL, noSQL, SQLite, and Access, with hands-on experience in database creation, maintenance, and optimization. <br />
Python Power: Skilled in Python for everything from automating workflows to advanced data analysis, machine learning, and ArcGIS scripting.  <br />
Statistical Insight: Expertise in statistical analysis using Python and R, with a keen ability to turn data into actionable insights.
Automation Aficionado: I thrive on streamlining tasks and boosting productivity through automation, particularly with VBA and Python.
📊 Past Experience: Assistant Docent at University of Patras
During my time as an Assistant Docent, I honed my ability to simplify complex concepts in Numerical Analysis and Differential Equations, making me not just a technical expert but also an effective communicator and educator.
🌟 Why I Stand Out: I’m not just about crunching numbers or writing code—I’m about creating value. Whether it’s through automating a tedious process, developing a robust database, or applying machine learning to solve real-world problems, my goal is to make a tangible impact.
